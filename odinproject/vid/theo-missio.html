          <p>This is so and so and he is discussing a basic theology of missions. This is not incredibly in depth but is a step beyond introductory material. Every Christian should have this level of understanding regarding missions at the very least, and as one grows in their faith a greater level of understanding (And involvement) in missions is to be expected. This is based upon the myriad commands, comments, examples and explanations regarding missions and the church found throughout the Bible.</p>

              <br>
          <p>The stance held by the early church is very clear. Much can be gleaned from Jesus' interactions with the disciples, the booke of Acts and several of the epistles. To gain an even greater udnerstanding of the Church's posture regarding missions, one would do well to study the writings of the Apostolic fathers, as well as the writings of early church leaders and apologists, and those writings of other church members including those awaiting martyrdom.</p>

          <p>While preparation to fulfill the missional call and the myriad unique circumstances we may find ourselves are not exhaustively addressed in the Bible... prayer, common sense, fellow believers, and the rich history of missions go a long way in helping us to fulfill our call. Apologetics, in a missional sense, may be seen as that form of service which looks to address the various stumbling blocks that are unique to those geographies, cultures, and demographics to whom we find ourselves coming into contact.</p>
